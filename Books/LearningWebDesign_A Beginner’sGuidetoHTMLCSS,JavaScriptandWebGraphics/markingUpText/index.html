        <blockquote>
            <p>Our alphabet hasn't changes in eons; there isn't much latitude in down.
                It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
                conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in the interpretation.

                Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written
                down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
                comductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in the interpretation.
