1- Create a varible "n" with the value 71.
2- Create an "if" statement that detects if varible "n" is greater than 45.
3- Inside that "if" statement, create another "if" statement that detects if
the same varible is smaller than 65.
4- Inside that "if" statement, add a "console.log" that shows the value of
the varible "n".
5- The value of "n" will not initially even if you hit "Run".
6- Change the  value of "n" until it shows on terminal.
